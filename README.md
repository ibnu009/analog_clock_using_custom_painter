## About App

This project is an alarm app that the time off of the alarm can be set by moving the clock hands, and when the alarm is on you will received the notification once the alarm went off at the selected time. And then the app will calculate your duration between the time alarm went off and the time you pressed the notification. The calculation will be presented in bar chart which is the y-axis is the time you set the alarm and the x-axis is the duration (in seconds).

2. Choose either "AM" or "PM"
3. Press the switch button at the top right corner (it will show you message at the bottom if it activated)
